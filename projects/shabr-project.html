             <p> This is my Shabr project that I create using my knowledge of Bootstrap that I learned on my own. Over a week, I learned parts of bootstrap slowly by myself on their website, and used it whenever needed. </p>
             <p>There were a few challenges that I came across doing this project. The one that I remember the most is messing up the order of my code. I added the link for bootstrap and the things needed for popover in the wrong order, and I was super confused at first why it didn't work. Luckily, I tinkered with the code around and found the solution. Another challenge that was at the same time fun was tinkering with new code. I have to read it slowly, part by part, to understand what's going on and where changes are needed. During this process, I realized that a "safety dump" really helped me out while coding. Since I was afraid I would break my code, I copy and pasted my original code at the bottom as a comment in case I need it back. </p>
             <p>I feel like this was my proudest and most fun project because I can create a website on my own however I like it. It was frustrating at times, but it only satisfies me after I understand the tool in the end. </p>
